# Hop on Pop

First, lets load in the file we want to use. We'll use this file to create a huge transition matrix of words that will allow us to **generate new text** that's similar to what's in our file (much simpler than a transformer...don't you think?).

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
fileName <- file.choose()
fox <- readChar(fileName, file.info(fileName)$size)

```

Next, we'll pre-process the text.

```{r preprocess}
# clean string to get rid of dots
words <- fox %>% tolower() %>%
  # get rid of punctuation and split by word
  gsub("\\.", "",.) %>%
  gsub('[[:punct:]]+','',.) %>%
  strsplit(., "\\s+") %>%
  unlist()

# grab unique words
unique_words <- unique(words) %>% sort()

```

This makes sure that things like punctuation, and capitalization don't impact our Dr. Seuss generator. Now that it's clean, we can create our transition matrix. This transition matrix encodes **transition probabilities** between words.

For example, for the sentence `"the cat and the fish looked at the pool"` the transition diagram looks like:

![](../../Images/MCMC/cattransmat.png){fig-align="center"}

and the transition matrix looks like:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0.33 & 0 & 0 & 0& 0& 0& 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0& 0\\
0.33 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0& 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0& 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0& 0\\
0.33 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

To estimate these transition probabilities, we'll first look at, for each word, the number of times any given word in our vocabulary comes *after* that word.

```{r transitionprob}
# create empty matrix
trans <- matrix(rep(0,length(unique_words)^2), ncol = length(unique_words))

# get transition counts
for (w in 1:length(words)){
  i <- which(unique_words == words[w])
  j <- which(unique_words == words[w + 1])
  trans[i,j] <- trans[i,j] + 1
}

# change counts into probabilities
trans <- t(trans)
trans <- sweep(trans, 2, colSums(trans), FUN="/")
```

## Your Turn

Let's write a function `get_word()` which takes in:

-   `word_idx`: the index (starting at `1`) of the current word

-   `trans`: the transition matrix we just created above

and returns the index of the *newly* chosen word. Words should be chosen randomly based on the probabilities in the transition matrix. Remember, in the transition matrix, `trans`, `trans[row,column]` represents the probability of going **from** the word `unique_words[column]` to the word `unique_words[row]`. `trans[,column]` gives you a simplex of probabilities of going from `unique_words[column]` to any of the possible word choices.

Work with your groups, and don't be afraid to google! But use this as an opportunity to get used to R syntax.

```{r yourfunc}
get_word <- function(word_idx, trans){
  
  ### YOUR CODE HERE ###
  
  ######################
  # return new word index
  return(new_idx)
}

```

## Simulate

Now that we have defined what an individual markov step will look like, let's simulate a new Dr. Seuss verse!

```{r generate}

# simulate new dr. seuss
sim_len <- 125
ww <- sample(1:length(unique_words),1)
word_list <- c(ww,rep(0, sim_len))

for(i in 2:(sim_len+1)){
  ww <- get_word(ww, trans = trans)
  word_list[i] <- ww
}

# line length
linelen <- 6

# get all simulated words
out <- sapply(word_list, function(x) unique_words[[x]])

# print out line by line
for(i in seq(1,length(out), by = linelen)){
  print(paste(out[i:(i+linelen-1)], collapse = " "))
}
```

## Reflection Questions

1.  Does this example fulfill the Markov Property? What is the Markov Property?

2.  What are other ways you could define a "state" in this example that might give you better results?

# Markov Schedule

In Markov-polis, the weather is determined only by yesterday's weather. The following diagram shows the probability of each weather state (cloudy, rainy, sunny) given the previous day's weather.

## Make a Transition Matrix

Using the graph above, create a transition matrix for the weather states.

![weather mc](images/04-05 Markov Chain Monte Carlo.png){fig-align="center"}

```{r}
weather_mat <- matrix(c(), nrow = 3,
                      byrow = TRUE)



```

## Simulate Weather

Using your matrix, simulate a **week's** worth of weather states, and print them out (think about how to use matrix multiplication (`%*%` in R) to do this simply).

What proportion of days are sunny, rainy, and cloudy?

Now simulate 5 years worth of weather states. What proportion of days are sunny, rainy, and cloudy?

## Steady State

Before doing any explicit estimates of it, what do you *think* the steady state of your system is (if there is one)?

Now, use R to calculate the steady state exactly (not through simulation). What is it? How did you calculate it? Why does that calculation work?

```{r steadystate}

```

Did your markov chain reach it's steady state right away? or did it take a few draws before it reached the steady state?

# The Snobby Teacher

Let's say there's a teacher who has 6 tables worth of students. Table 1, Table 2, ..., Table 6. She wants to spend time with each table *in proportion* to their rating of her from a scale of 0-10 (10 being the best, 0 being the worst).

Write a Metropolis Sampler that allows Chelsea...I mean the snobby teacher...to choose which tables to spend time with. She'll have the opportunity to switch tables every 10 *minutes*. The rules are:

-   The teacher does **not** want to keep track of the ratings each table gave her (she can yell across the room and ask for their ratings each time), nor which tables she's visited

-   The teacher wants some randomness in the choice of table

-   The teacher wants to visit the tables in proportion to their rating of her

```{r metropolis}
library(ggplot2)

choose_table <- function(current_table){
  
  # table ratings
  ratings <- list("1" = 9.2,
                  "2" = 8.6,
                  "3" = 2.2,
                  "4" = 7.5,
                  "5" = 9.4,
                  "6" = 4.7)
  
  # write a function that chooses a new table and decides whether to accept the new table
}

# simulate 10,000 minutes (1000 states) worth of class time

# plot the proportion of time spent with each table using ggplot

# plot the chain by putting the sampled value on the y-axis and the index (1-1000) on the x-axis

# BONUS: add to choose_table() to keep track of whether a sample was a result of accepting a proposal, or staying at the current value (rejecting the proposal). What proportion of samples were accepted?
```

When you implemented this, how did you propose a new table to go to? Re-write your function using a *new* proposal method. Run the simulation again, did you get similar results?
