## Exercise's Effect on Chol

In the data set [cholExercise.csv](), we have various health and lifestyle variables about 1000 different patients at Dr. Pearl's primary care practice.

1.  In your group, draw out a DAG that you think is reasonable based on the variables provided (make the simplifying assumption that there are no unmeasured confounders). You can do this by hand or with `dagitty` and `ggdag`. Or try [dagitty](https://www.dagitty.net/) online!

2.  Using `R`, try to get a *direct* causal estimate of the effect of exercise on cholesterol. Use any of the methods we talked about in class.
