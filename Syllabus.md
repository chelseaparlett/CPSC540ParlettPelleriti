## Course Description

This course covers a range of topics in Statistical Machine Learning including the Mathematical foundations of machine learning, data preprocessing (including scaling, dimensionality reduction, and imputation), Bayesian and Frequentist inference (including particular-use models which may include Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models, Mixed Effect Models, Survival Analysis, and Item Response Theory), longitudinal data models (including repeated measures and time series), and ethical considerations that arise through the application of these topics. (Prerequisites: Statistics, Linear Algebra, Python/R coding, Probability Theory).

## Course Learning Outcomes

The goal of this course is to provide students with foundational knowledge of statistical concepts that underlie Statistical and Machine Learning Models so that they can build, interpret, and communicate about these models in their data work. By the end of the semester, students will be able to: 

-   Understand key foundational concepts that underpin Statistical and Machine Learning models 
-   Appropriately preprocess data, analyze data using statistical models, and communicate about analysis results to both expert and novice audiences  
-   Make inferences about statistical models in both a Bayesian and Frequentist framework 
-   Understand necessary requirements to make causal inferences 
-   Analyze longitudinal data  

## Program Learning Outcomes

The Chapman experience creates outcomes which are consistent with our identity. Similar to the General Education program, each degree program, or major, at Chapman has a unique set of learning outcomes, or student abilities that are not only related to Chapman's institutional mission and goals, but also unique to the student's discipline or field of study. For more information, [**Fowler School of Engineering Program Learning Outcomes**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OESCtPUolnWFV_qRFuRzNrzxmUtYr5H-dFaYVmPUKY0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Overview 

CPSC 540 is a graduate level course designed to deepen students’ understanding of the statistical foundations of Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling. After a brief review of fundamental concepts in probability, statistics, and linear algebra, students will learn how to use inferential models and apply them to both simulated and real world data. Topics include longitudinal models (including repeated measures and time series), data preprocessing (including scaling and imputation), bayesian and frequentist inference, causal inference, ethics, and commonly used generalized models. Applications within the course will include a range of fields from sports, to psychology, to marketing, to other scientific fields. 

## Units:

CPSC 540 is a 3 unit course.

## Required Text:

See [Resources]() and [Course Schedule]()

## Course materials:

All course materials will be made available via Slack, Canvas and/or Github

## Homework, Exams, and Grading (subject to change):

Homework will consist of assignments to reinforce material covered in class, and must be submitted electronically. They will typically be due at 11:59pm (unless otherwise specified). Homeworks and Final Project must be turned in with a README file as either a .txt or a .md file (see Admin Folder on GitHub for a template). Homework files must be turned in in the format specified (see **Collaboration Policy** below for more information).

### Late Days

Stuff happens. So, you have 8 "extra days" that you can use, no questions asked, throughout the semester for any homework or project (NOT Quizzes and Tests). You must use 1 whole extra day at a time (i.e. you cannot use 3 hours of an extra day for one assignment, and 21 on another). If an assignment was due Monday at 11:59pm and you use 1 late day, the assignment would then be due Tuesday at 11:59pm. **It is your responsibility** to keep track of the number of late days you have, and how many you have used.

To qualify for an extra day, you must fill out the **Late Days Google Form** linked on Canvas under the Syllabus Tab *BEFORE the assignment is due*, and add a **comment** to your Canvas submission saying "I used \_\_\_\_ late days" (e.g. "I used 2 late days"). *Because of grading deadlines, extra days CANNOT be used during finals week and may NOT prevent peer feedback during the final project.*

Late work will automatically be penalized a 0.15% per hour (or part of an hour) late if no late day is used.

Again, to use a **Late Day**:

1.  Fill out the Google Form
2.  Leave a Comment on your Canvas Submission

Failure to follow these instructions may result in the late day not being applied.

### Assignments

All programs should be written in **R** unless otherwise specified or cleared with Professor, and should use the packages taught in this course. Grading will be based on correctness, clarity, elegance of solution, and style (comments, naming conventions, etc.). Assignments must reflect your own work, and any outside resources (including--but not limited to--tutors, websites, books, LLMs...etc.) must be cited in your README file with specific links, specific prompts (if using an LLM), or specific citations.

### Assessment Structure

There will be weekly quizzes on the lecture material and classwork, which will count toward the Quizzes grade. **You MUST be in person to take the quiz**. Missed quizzes cannot be made up at a different time. However, I will **drop your lowest 1 quiz score**, so use this dropped quiz to account for sick days or missed classes.

There will also be two in-class exams: one midterm and one final. In-class exams must be taken **in-person** on the dates specified, however *I don't believe taking tests while sick demonstrates your true ability, so in the case of a well-documented, unavoidable conflict or illness, I will do my best to accommodate you. You must notify me prior to missing the exam.*

## Collaboration Policy:

### Human Collaboration

You have much to learn from your classmates, and so I encourage you to discuss and study course material together. However, all work you submit for this course must be your own, and must be completed individually unless otherwise specified. More specifically, you **may not present source code or programs copied from the Internet, Large Language Models (or other AI), other texts, other students, etc as your own work**. Of course, you are free to use whatever reference materials you like, but please cite them in a README turned in with your assignments. I assume you are familiar with Chapman's policy on academic misconduct is presented below and any incidents of academic misconduct or dishonesty will be dealt with severely in accordance with this policy.

### AI Collaboration

AI (such as ChatGPT, and other Large Language Models) should not be used to do assignments for you (they are completely prohibited on Exams and Quizzes), however these tools are often useful for debugging code. If you use output from an AI model you must cite it in your readme in the following form:

-   The exact prompt(s) you put into the model
-   Any clarifications or changes you asked for from the model
-   Which part(s) of the assignment/assessment this output was used in

If AI is used to the extent that the assignment is deemed to not be your own work, the assignment will not be accepted and a 0 will be given for any portion(s) deemed not your work.

## Expectations and Technology

I expect that everyone will maintain a classroom conducive to learning. Thus, everyone is expected to behave with basic politeness, civility, and respect for others. In particular, talking in class is okay if it’s part of a class discussion or with me. Private communications are not permitted, especially during exams. Neither are reading extraneous materials, using electronic equipment off task, or sleeping. As this is a Computer Science class, technology is allowed to aid in learning and understanding material. However, please do not use a personal device for any purpose unrelated to our class. All devices should be silenced. Cell phones should be put away. Suggestions for improvement are welcome at any time. Any concern about the course should be brought first to my attention.
