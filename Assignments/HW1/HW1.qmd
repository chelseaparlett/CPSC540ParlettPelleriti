# Homework 1

**Due October 27th, 2024 by 11:59pm**

For this homework assignment, choose one data set below (or slack me about a data set you want to use, e.g. for your research...). As this is a **graduate course** it is expected that you use course materials to complete this assignment, but also that **you do some research on your own to find helpful extensions relevant the course material** (e.g. if you're measuring reaction time, maybe a *gamma* likelihood would help, even if we didn't talk specifically about gamma regression; if you have a Likert scale item, maybe cumulative logit models would help)

-   look into the data set and describe in Intro/**Background**

-   choose one of the **research questions** associated with each data set (or come up with your own, equally complex Q!)

-   propose an **Analysis** (using the *tools/types of models we learned in class*, and any EDA tools such as plots, summaries) that answers the research question in the **Analysis** section. Also explain **why** you chose the analysis you did.

    -   You **must** use models we covered in class, or extensions of these models. For example, I don't want you fitting neural networks. I want you to use the statistical models covered in this class, or closely related (check with me if you're unsure). For example: Ordinal Regression would be okay, Convolutional Neural Networks would not.

-   **run** the analysis, and present results in **Results** section

-   discuss your findings in the **Discussion.** Also discuss limitations/roadblocks

Your assignment should include all of the following elements:

-   Causal Inference

-   Modeling (GLMs, GAMs)

-   2+ plots

Your assignment *can* but doesn't need to:

-   use hypothesis testing

-   use p-values/bayes factors

## Groups

If you would like to work in a group of **up to 2** you can, but must choose **one research question** per **person** (two total), using the *same data set*. You must let Dr. P know who is in your group before **October 15th EOD**.

# Report Sections

You should turn in a **readme**, a **code** file (.R, .Rmd, .qmd...etc) of your R code for analysis and a written **report**. The report should have the following sections:

-   **Intro/Background**: Tell us about your **data set**, and your **research question**. Do some exploratory data analysis (make plots of relevant variables, make note of missing data, interesting patterns, relevant variables).

-   **Analysis**: Tell us **how** you plan to answer the questions using a combination of models, summaries, and data visualization. Also explain **why** you chose the analysis you did.

-   **Results**: What is the **answer** to your research question? What did the analysis tell you? This is where you share plots, coefficients from models, summaries, etc.

-   **Discussion**: What are the **potential impacts/applications** of the answers you found? Were there any **limitations**? What would you do **differently** next time if you re-did the same assignment?

As a reminder, I expect the following files when you turn in your assignment:

-   PDF of report

-   code file (.R, .qmd, .Rmd)

-   a readme (.txt, .md)
